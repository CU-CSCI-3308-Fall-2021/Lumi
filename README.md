## Project Description
LUMI is designed to help snowboarders / ski enthusiasts ensure their safety and best experience while havimg fun. We provide information of weather predictions and snow levels of different ski resorts that will be shown towards users. In addition, new users will be given a quick survey in order to assign them a certain level of snowboarding experience which then allows them to be recommended to ski resorts that complies with their experience. Not to mention, we'd provide users reviews and ticket links to help them get easy access towards ski resorts and their information.

## Application Architecture
LUMI will be designed using HTML and CSS for the frontend and will use Javascript as their backend. The database of the users will be stored using MongoDB and to deploy, we will be using Heroku as our provider.
